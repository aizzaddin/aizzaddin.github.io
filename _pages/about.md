Hi there! My name is Muhammad Wildan Aizzaddin, but most people just call me Wildan. I am a Backend Engineer currently working at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk, where I started my journey in November 2021.

I completed my undergraduate program in Computer Engineering from Universitas AMIKOM Yogyakarta, and I've been passionate about coding ever since. My tech stack includes Java, Javascript, Python, Springboot, NestJS, Feign, SQL or NoSQL Database, RestAPI, and more. I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.

Aside from coding, I have a few hobbies that keep me busy. I love photography, and I always carry my camera around to capture beautiful moments. I also enjoy watching movies, especially sci-fi and action genres, and traveling to new places whenever I have the chance.
